# Group Project ~ Vim Gallery


## What is Vim Gallery?

### Vim gallery presents a website dedicated to visuals with a discovery engine for finding desired ideas/inspiration on wallpapers, photography, videography and so on. we want our users to make the most of this site by browsing, sharing, and downloading both images and videos for both personal and commercial use.  

## User Story

### Given I am a user who wants to find a background wallpaper.                                                              
When I enter the name of a background and click the search button.
Then I am presented with several images to choose from.

## Future Improvements

### We were not able to make the login and signup buttons functionable so in future, when we have the knowledge do so, we will fix it.

Spending more time on tailwind to wrap our minds around it as it was not as straightforward in comparison to Vanilla css.
